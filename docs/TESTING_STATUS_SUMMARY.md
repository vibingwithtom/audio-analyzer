## Key Achievements

### ✅ Validation Testing Excellence
- Comprehensive coverage of all filename patterns
- Tests for edge cases (case sensitivity, missing fields, invalid formats)
- Supports Three Hour and Bilingual presets with proper validation
- File type detection now handles 30+ test cases

### ✅ File Validation Implementation & Testing
- File type validation implemented across all tabs (Google Drive, Box, Local)
- 73 dedicated tests ensure robust file filtering
- Prevents bandwidth waste by rejecting unsupported formats early
- Performance optimizations verified through tests

### ✅ Test Growth & Momentum
- **41% increase in tests** (729 → 1,027+)
- **Consistent testing pattern** established (clear file naming, structure)
- **Low test maintenance** (most tests are stable, not flaky)
- **Good team momentum** (validation strategy worked well)

## Outstanding Questions

### 1. Should Phase 1 include direct store tests?
**Current Situation:** Settings manager tested, but stores not directly tested
**Options:**
- Option A: Keep as-is (manager layer covers stores indirectly)
- Option B: Add direct store tests (belt & suspenders approach)
**Recommendation:** Keep as-is for Phase 1; add to Phase 1b if coverage insufficient

### 2. What's the exact current coverage percentage?
**Current:** ~25-30% estimated
**Action:** Run `npm run test:coverage` to get exact baseline
**Why:** Needed to update strategy doc accurately

### 3. Should we start Phase 2 or finish Phase 1 completely?
**Current:** Phase 1 can be finished in 1 week (7-10 hours)
**Recommendation:** Complete Phase 1 first; it's close to done
**Reasoning:** Builds momentum, cleaner milestone

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Validation testing pattern** - Comprehensive, maintainable tests
2. **File organization** - Clear naming convention makes tests easy to find
3. **Mock strategy** - Consistent use of Vitest mocks
4. **Progressive approach** - Phase 1 → 2 → 3 is pragmatic

### What Could Be Improved
1. **Documentation lag** - Strategy doc wasn't updated as work progressed
2. **Store testing ambiguity** - Unclear whether manager or direct testing is primary
3. **Coverage tracking** - Could have been tracked more frequently
4. **Component testing** - Still hasn't started (Phase 2)

### Recommendations for Phase 2
1. Update strategy doc at end of each week
2. Run coverage report monthly
3. Set clear metrics for component testing
4. Consider E2E tests for OAuth flows earlier
