# Voice Quality Features - Performance Impact Analysis

## Executive Summary

All 8 voice quality features combined would add approximately **15-25%** to total experimental analysis time. However, features can be implemented incrementally and selectively enabled per preset, allowing you to control performance impact.

## Current Baseline Performance

**Existing Experimental Analysis** (when enabled):
- Reverb Analysis: ~35% of total experimental time
- Silence Detection: ~25% of total experimental time
- Clipping Analysis: ~40% of total experimental time
- **Total Experimental**: Approximately **2-4x** longer than base analysis

For a typical 5-minute stereo file at 48kHz:
- Base analysis (peak, noise floor, normalization): ~500-800ms
- Experimental analysis (reverb, silence, clipping): ~1500-2500ms
- **Total current**: ~2-3 seconds

## Filter Efficiency & Shared Processing

### Potential Filter Sharing

Several features use overlapping frequency bands:

```
Sibilance (4-10 kHz)
    └─ High band overlaps with Frequency Balance (2-8 kHz)

Frequency Balance Mid (250-2000 Hz)
    └─ Overlaps with Sibilance Speech Band (200-3000 Hz)

Plosive Energy (50-200 Hz)
    └─ Overlaps with Breath Sounds (100-400 Hz)
```

**Optimization**: Implement shared filter cache

**Potential Savings**: 3-5% if filters are shared

**Implementation Complexity**: Medium (requires refactoring)

---

## Memory Impact

### Per-Feature Memory Requirements

| Feature | Additional Memory | Notes |
|---------|------------------|-------|
| Sibilance | 2x buffer | Two filtered channels |
| Frequency Balance | 3x buffer | Three frequency bands |
| Plosive Clipping | Negligible | Reuses existing data |
| Plosive Energy | 1x buffer | One filtered channel |
| Mouth Noise | 1x buffer | Edge segments only |
| Breath Sounds | 1x buffer | One filtered channel |
| Voice Reverb | 1x buffer | Voice-filtered channel |
| Room Tone | Negligible | Statistics only |

**Worst Case**: 9x audio buffer (if all enabled simultaneously)

**For 5-min stereo 48kHz file**:
- Original buffer: ~57 MB
- With all features: ~570 MB peak memory

**Mitigation**: Process sequentially, free buffers after use

---

## Performance Optimization Strategies

### 1. Sequential Processing (Recommended)

Process features one at a time, freeing memory between:

```javascript
// Good: Sequential
const sibilance = await analyzeSibilance(...);
freeSibilanceBuffers();

const frequencyBalance = await analyzeFrequencyBalance(...);
freeFrequencyBuffers();

// Memory never exceeds 3x buffer
```

### 2. Filter Caching (Advanced)

Cache commonly used filtered audio:

```javascript
// Cache voice-band filtered audio
const voiceBandCache = applyBandpassFilter(audio, 200, 8000);

// Reuse for multiple analyses
analyzeSibilance(voiceBandCache, ...);
analyzeFrequencyBalance(voiceBandCache, ...);
```

**Savings**: 2-4% processing time
**Trade-off**: +1x buffer memory

### 3. Preset-Based Selection

Enable only relevant features per preset:

```javascript
presets: {
  'auditions': {
    voiceFeatures: ['sibilance', 'frequencyBalance', 'plosiveClipping']
  },
  'bilingual-conversational': {
    voiceFeatures: ['sibilance', 'breathSounds', 'roomTone']
  }
}
```

**Benefit**: Minimize processing for each use case

### 4. Adaptive Analysis

Skip expensive features on obviously problematic files:

```javascript
if (clippingAnalysis.sustainedClips > 100) {
  // File is badly clipped, skip subtle analyses
  skipMouthNoise = true;
  skipBreathSounds = true;
}
```

**Benefit**: Faster feedback on clearly failed files

### Incremental Rollout Strategy

1. **Week 1**: Deploy Tier 1 (minimal impact, high value)
