**Effort:** 2-3 hours
**What to do:**
1. Run coverage report: `npm run test:coverage`
2. Identify components with 0% coverage
3. Prioritize by usage frequency and complexity
4. Create list of components to test

**Output:** `PHASE_2_STRATEGY.md` with component test plan

---

#### Action 2: Create Component Test Infrastructure
**Effort:** 2-3 hours
**What to do:**
1. Set up Svelte component testing utilities (if not already done)
2. Create test fixtures for common patterns
3. Create mock implementations for services
4. Document component testing patterns

**Files to create:**
- `packages/web/tests/components/ComponentTestSetup.svelte`
- `packages/web/tests/utils/component-test-helpers.js`

---

#### Action 3: Start Component Tests
**Priority Order:**
1. **LocalFileTab.svelte** (highest impact - primary user interface)
2. **ResultsTable.svelte** (core results display)
3. **ResultsDisplay.svelte** (results container)
4. **SettingsTab.svelte** (configuration UI)

**Per Component Effort:** 2-3 hours each

---

### Phase 2 Success Criteria
