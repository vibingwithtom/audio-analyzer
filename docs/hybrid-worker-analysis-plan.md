# Hybrid Worker Analysis Plan
## Decode on Main Thread, Analyze in Workers

**Created:** 2025-10-19
**Status:** Proposed
**Approach:** Decode audio on main thread, transfer channel data to workers for analysis

---

## Executive Summary

After extensive investigation, we discovered:
1. **Web Workers CANNOT decode audio** (no OfflineAudioContext in workers)
2. **AudioWorklets CANNOT decode audio** (only process already-decoded audio)
3. **Performance traces show freezes during BOTH decode AND analysis**
4. **NEW INSIGHT:** We can decode on main thread, then analyze in workers!

**Expected Impact:**
- Decode freeze: ~2-3 seconds (unavoidable, but shorter)
- Analysis freeze: **ELIMINATED** (runs in worker)
- Total improvement: 50-70% reduction in freeze duration

---

## What We Learned Today

### Performance Trace Analysis

From the Chrome DevTools performance recording:

**Freeze Breakdown (estimated from trace):**
- `AudioContext.decodeAudioData()`: ~2-3 seconds
- `analyzeExperimental()`: ~3-4 seconds
- **Total freeze per problematic file: ~6 seconds**

**Key Finding:** The freeze is happening in TWO places:
1. Decode (main thread, unavoidable)
2. Analysis (main thread, **MOVABLE TO WORKER!**)

### Current Situation

**What we have:**
- 60% faster overall (65s vs 157s for 137 files)
- 6-second freezes every ~14 files
- All processing on main thread

**What we could have:**
- 60% faster overall (maintained)
- 2-3 second freezes every ~14 files (60% reduction!)
- Decode on main, analysis in worker

---

## Architecture

### Current Flow (All Main Thread)

```
File → ArrayBuffer → decodeAudioData() → AudioBuffer
                          ↓ 2-3s freeze
                     LevelAnalyzer
                          ↓ 3-4s freeze
                     Results
```

### Proposed Flow (Hybrid)

```
MAIN THREAD                          WORKER THREAD
-----------                          -------------
File → ArrayBuffer
  ↓
decodeAudioData()
  ↓ 2-3s freeze (unavoidable)
AudioBuffer
  ↓
Extract Float32Arrays ────────────→ Receive Float32Arrays
                                         ↓
                  UI stays responsive    ↓
                                    LevelAnalyzer
                                         ↓
                                    analyzeWithData()
                                         ↓
Results ←──────────────────────── Results
```

### Data Transfer

**Key insight:** `Float32Array.buffer` is Transferable!

```javascript
// Main thread
const channels = [];
for (let i = 0; i < audioBuffer.numberOfChannels; i++) {
  channels.push(audioBuffer.getChannelData(i).buffer);
}

// Transfer ownership (no copying!)
worker.postMessage({
  channels,
  sampleRate: audioBuffer.sampleRate,
  length: audioBuffer.length
}, channels); // Transferable list
```

**Benefits:**
- No memory copying (transfer ownership)
- ~250MB transferred instantly
- Main thread can continue

---

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Create Analysis Worker

**File:** `/packages/web/src/workers/analysis-worker.js`

```javascript
import { LevelAnalyzer } from '@audio-analyzer/core';

self.onmessage = async (event) => {
  const { type, data } = event.data;

  if (type === 'ANALYZE') {
    try {
      const { channels, sampleRate, length, config } = data;

      // Reconstruct Float32Arrays from transferred buffers
      const channelData = channels.map(buf => new Float32Array(buf));

      // Create analyzer
      const analyzer = new LevelAnalyzer();

      // Run analysis (all the heavy work!)
      const results = await analyzer.analyzeFromChannelData(
        channelData,
        sampleRate,
        length,
        config.peakDetectionMode
      );

      // Send results back
      self.postMessage({
        type: 'RESULT',
        data: { results }
      });

    } catch (error) {
      self.postMessage({
        type: 'ERROR',
        data: { error: error.message }
      });
    }
  }
};
```

### Phase 2: Modify LevelAnalyzer

**Current:** `analyzeAudioBuffer(audioBuffer, ...)`
**Add:** `analyzeFromChannelData(channelData, sampleRate, length, ...)`

```javascript
// In level-analyzer.js
analyzeFromChannelData(channelData, sampleRate, length, peakDetectionMode) {
  // Create a minimal object that looks like AudioBuffer
  const audioBufferLike = {
    numberOfChannels: channelData.length,
    length: length,
    sampleRate: sampleRate,
    getChannelData: (index) => channelData[index]
  };

  // Use existing analysis logic
  return this.analyzeAudioBuffer(audioBufferLike, null, true, peakDetectionMode);
}
```

### Phase 3: Create Worker Manager

**File:** `/packages/web/src/services/analysis-worker-manager.ts`

```typescript
class AnalysisWorkerManager {
  private worker: Worker | null = null;
  private supportsWorkers: boolean;

  constructor() {
    this.supportsWorkers = typeof Worker !== 'undefined';

    if (this.supportsWorkers) {
      this.worker = new Worker(
        new URL('../workers/analysis-worker.js', import.meta.url),
        { type: 'module' }
      );
    }
  }

  async analyze(audioBuffer: AudioBuffer, config: AnalysisConfig): Promise<any> {
    if (!this.supportsWorkers || !this.worker) {
      // Fallback: analyze on main thread (current implementation)
      return this.analyzeOnMainThread(audioBuffer, config);
    }

    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      const messageHandler = (event: MessageEvent) => {
        const { type, data } = event.data;

        if (type === 'RESULT') {
          this.worker!.removeEventListener('message', messageHandler);
          resolve(data.results);
        } else if (type === 'ERROR') {
          this.worker!.removeEventListener('message', messageHandler);
          reject(new Error(data.error));
        }
      };

      this.worker.addEventListener('message', messageHandler);

      // Extract channel data
      const channels = [];
      for (let i = 0; i < audioBuffer.numberOfChannels; i++) {
        channels.push(audioBuffer.getChannelData(i).buffer);
      }

      // Transfer to worker
      this.worker.postMessage({
        type: 'ANALYZE',
        data: {
          channels,
          sampleRate: audioBuffer.sampleRate,
          length: audioBuffer.length,
          config
        }
      }, channels);
    });
  }

  private analyzeOnMainThread(audioBuffer: AudioBuffer, config: AnalysisConfig) {
    // Current implementation as fallback
    const analyzer = new LevelAnalyzer();
    return analyzer.analyzeAudioBuffer(audioBuffer, null, true, config.peakDetectionMode);
  }
}

export const workerManager = new AnalysisWorkerManager();
```

### Phase 4: Integrate with audio-analysis-service.ts

```typescript
// In analyzeExperimental()
async function analyzeExperimental(
  arrayBuffer: ArrayBuffer,
  progressCallback?: (message: string, progress: number) => void
): Promise<Partial<AudioResults>> {
  const audioContext = new (window.AudioContext || (window as any).webkitAudioContext)();

  // Decode on main thread (freeze still happens here)
  const audioBuffer = await audioContext.decodeAudioData(arrayBuffer);

  try {
    // Analyze in worker (NO FREEZE!)
    const advancedResults = await workerManager.analyze(audioBuffer, {
      peakDetectionMode: SettingsManager.getPeakDetectionMode()
    });

    return advancedResults;
  } finally {
    audioContext.close();
  }
}
```

## Browser Compatibility

### Worker Support

| Browser | Web Workers | Module Workers | Support Level |
|---------|-------------|----------------|---------------|
| Chrome | ✅ Always | ✅ 80+ | Full |
| Firefox | ✅ Always | ✅ 114+ | Full |
| Safari | ✅ Always | ⚠️ Limited | Fallback to classic worker |
| Edge | ✅ Always | ✅ 80+ | Full |
| Opera | ✅ Always | ✅ 67+ | Full |

**Key:** All browsers support Web Workers, so worst case is fallback to main thread (current behavior).

### Implementation Strategy

```javascript
// Try module worker first
try {
  worker = new Worker(new URL('./worker.js', import.meta.url), { type: 'module' });
} catch {
  // Fallback: bundle worker code or use classic worker
  worker = new Worker('/bundled-worker.js');
}
```

---

## Expected Performance Impact

### Current (All Main Thread)

**137 files in experimental mode:**
- Total time: ~65 seconds
- Freezes: ~10 freezes × 6 seconds each = 60 seconds frozen
- User sees: Frequent long pauses

### With Hybrid Workers

**137 files in experimental mode:**
- Total time: ~65 seconds (same)
- Decode freezes: ~10 freezes × 2.5 seconds = 25 seconds frozen
- Analysis: Runs in background (no freeze)
- User sees: Brief occasional pauses, much smoother

**Improvement: 60% reduction in freeze duration**

---

## Benefits vs. Previous Approach

### Failed Approach: Full Workers

**Problem:** Tried to decode in workers (impossible)
**Result:** Wasted time, not viable

### New Approach: Hybrid Workers

**What works:** Decode on main, analyze in worker
**Result:** Viable, simpler, effective

### Comparison

| Aspect | Current | Full Workers | Hybrid Workers |
|--------|---------|--------------|----------------|
| Decode location | Main | Worker ❌ | Main |
| Analysis location | Main | Worker ❌ | Worker ✅ |
| Freeze duration | 6s | N/A | 2-3s |
| Browser support | 100% | 0% | 100% (with fallback) |
| Complexity | Low | N/A | Medium |
| Implementation time | Done | N/A | 1-2 days |

## Risks and Mitigation

### Risk 1: Module Workers Not Supported

**Impact:** Safari might not support ES module workers
**Mitigation:**
- Bundle worker code with Vite
- Or use classic worker with importScripts()
- Fallback to main thread if worker fails

### Risk 2: Worker Overhead

**Impact:** Creating/transferring to worker adds latency
**Mitigation:**
- Reuse single worker (don't recreate)
- Transfer is instant (ownership transfer, not copy)
- Test to verify no regression

### Risk 3: Progress Reporting

**Impact:** Progress callbacks don't work across threads
**Mitigation:**
- Worker can send progress messages
- Main thread updates UI via postMessage
- Might lose some granular progress (acceptable)

### Risk 4: Memory During Transfer

**Impact:** Brief moment where both threads hold references
**Mitigation:**
- Use Transferable objects (no copy)
- References are moved, not duplicated
- Should not increase peak memory

---

## Testing Requirements

### 1. Feature Detection Tests

```javascript
describe('Worker Support', () => {
  test('detects worker support', () => {
    expect(typeof Worker).toBe('function');
  });

  test('falls back to main thread gracefully', () => {
    // Mock Worker as undefined
    // Verify analysis still works
  });
});
```

### 2. Performance Tests

**Freeze duration:**
- Current: Measure 6s freezes
- With workers: Should see ~2-3s freezes
- Verify 50-60% improvement

**Total time:**
- Should remain ~65 seconds
- No regression in overall performance

### 3. Accuracy Tests

**Verify results match:**
- Run same file on main thread vs worker
- Compare all analysis results
- Should be identical

### 4. Browser Tests

- Chrome: Full worker support
- Firefox: Full worker support
- Safari: Test fallback if module workers don't work
- Edge: Full worker support

### 5. Stress Tests

- 137 files batch
- Memory usage monitoring
- Worker doesn't crash
- Fallback works if worker fails

## Alternative If This Doesn't Work

If hybrid workers don't help enough:

1. **Accept current solution** (still 60% faster overall)
2. **Reduce analysis scope** in experimental mode
3. **Direct WAV parsing** for peak detection only
4. **Warn users** about large batches

---

## Next Steps (Tomorrow)

1. Review this plan
2. Decide: Proceed with hybrid workers or ship current solution?
3. If proceeding: Start with Day 1 checklist
4. If shipping: Clean up profiling logs and deploy

---

## Questions to Answer

1. Is 60% freeze reduction worth the added complexity?
2. Should we make workers opt-in or default?
3. What's the fallback UX if workers fail?
4. How do we handle progress reporting across threads?
5. Should we process multiple files in parallel with worker pool?
