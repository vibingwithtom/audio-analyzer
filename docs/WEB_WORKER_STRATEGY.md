# Web Worker Strategy for Parallel Audio Analysis

## Problem
Certain audio analysis functions (e.g., `estimateReverb`, `analyzeSilence`, `analyzeClipping`) are CPU-intensive and iterate over large audio buffers. When processing multi-channel audio (e.g., stereo files), these operations are currently performed sequentially for each channel on the main thread. This can lead to increased processing times and potential UI unresponsiveness, even with yielding mechanisms.

## Solution: Web Workers
Web Workers provide a way to run scripts in background threads, separate from the main execution thread of a web page. This allows for true parallel processing of CPU-bound tasks without blocking the user interface.

## Proposed Implementation for Multi-Channel Analysis

1.  **Worker Script Creation:**
    *   Create a dedicated Web Worker script (e.g., `src/workers/audio-analysis.worker.js`).
    *   This script would import and expose the core analysis functions (e.g., `estimateReverb`, `analyzeSilence`) from `@audio-analyzer/core`.

2.  **Data Transfer:**
    *   The main thread would transfer the `Float32Array` data for each channel to the worker(s) using `postMessage()`. `Float32Array`s can be transferred efficiently using `transferable objects`, avoiding costly copying.

3.  **Worker Execution:**
    *   For multi-channel analysis (e.g., stereo), the main thread could:
        *   **Option A (One Worker per Channel):** Spawn a separate Web Worker for each channel. Each worker would receive its respective channel data and run the analysis function independently.
        *   **Option B (One Worker, Sequential Processing):** Spawn a single Web Worker and send it all channel data. The worker would then process each channel sequentially in its own background thread. This still offloads work from the main thread but doesn't offer true parallel CPU utilization for multi-channel.
    *   Option A is preferred for maximum parallelism.

4.  **Result Aggregation:**
    *   Once a worker completes its analysis, it would `postMessage()` the results back to the main thread.
    *   The main thread would listen for messages from all workers and aggregate the results.

## Benefits

*   **Improved UI Responsiveness:** CPU-intensive tasks are moved off the main thread, ensuring the UI remains fluid and interactive.
*   **Faster Multi-Channel Processing:** True parallel execution for multi-channel audio can significantly reduce overall analysis time.
*   **Scalability:** Easier to scale to more complex multi-channel formats in the future.

## Considerations

*   **Increased Complexity:** Implementing Web Workers adds a layer of architectural complexity to the application.
*   **Data Serialization/Deserialization:** While `Float32Array`s are efficient, other data structures passed between threads need to be serialized and deserialized.
*   **Error Handling:** Robust error handling mechanisms are needed for inter-thread communication.
*   **Debugging:** Debugging Web Workers can be more challenging than debugging main thread scripts.

## Future Steps

*   Prioritize based on performance bottlenecks identified in multi-channel analysis.
*   Design a clear API for worker communication.
*   Implement a proof-of-concept for a single analysis function (e.g., `estimateReverb`) using Web Workers.
