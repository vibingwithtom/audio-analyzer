## Technical Approach

### Recording Method: MediaRecorder API
✅ **Why MediaRecorder instead of RecordRTC**:
- Direct WAV output (no conversion needed)
- Built into all modern browsers
- Better performance (native implementation)
- Fewer dependencies
- RecordRTC available as fallback if needed

### Real-time Analysis: Web Audio API
✅ **Using AnalyserNode for**:
- Peak level detection (< 50ms latency)
- Average level tracking
- Clipping detection (threshold: 0.99 amplitude)
- Noise floor estimation
- CPU-efficient (< 5% target)

### Validation Strategy
✅ **Validates recorded audio against presets**:
- Sample rate must match exactly
- Channel count must match (mono/stereo)
- Duration must meet minimum requirement
- File format must be valid WAV
- Estimated bit depth from file size
