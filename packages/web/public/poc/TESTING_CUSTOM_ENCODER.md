# Testing the Custom 24-bit WAV Encoder POC

## ‚úÖ What's Been Implemented

The Phase 1.5 POC now includes a **custom 24-bit PCM WAV encoder** that:

### Key Features
- ‚úÖ Records **true 24-bit uncompressed PCM WAV** files
- ‚úÖ Works on **all modern browsers** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- ‚úÖ **No external dependencies** (all code in single HTML file)
- ‚úÖ **Real-time metrics** during recording (peak, average, clipping)
- ‚úÖ **WAV header validation** to confirm actual output format
- ‚úÖ **Future-proof** - you control the code, not dependent on unmaintained libraries
- ‚úÖ Supports both **16-bit and 24-bit** encoding

### What Changed
- **Removed**: RecordRTC library dependency
- **Added**: WAV24Encoder class (~120 lines of clean, documented code)
- **Architecture**: MediaStream ‚Üí Web Audio API ‚Üí ScriptProcessorNode ‚Üí WAV24Encoder ‚Üí WAV Blob
- **Result**: Complete control, no external library, guaranteed PCM format

## üß™ How to Test

### Browser Setup
The development server is already running at: `http://localhost:3000/`

### Quick Test (5 minutes)

1. **Open the POC**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/poc/recording-test/
   ```

2. **Run Compatibility Check**
   - Click "Run Compatibility Check" button
   - You should see:
     - ‚úì getUserMedia API
     - ‚úì Web Audio API
     - ‚úì MediaRecorder API (not used anymore, but still there for info)
     - ‚úì AudioWorklet/ScriptProcessor (for sample capture) ‚Üê NEW
     - ‚úì HTTPS (or localhost)

3. **Select Test Preset**
   - Select "Character Recordings" (48kHz, 24-bit, Mono)

4. **Record Audio**
   - Click "Start Recording"
   - Speak clearly for **5-10 seconds** (minimum 5 seconds for validation)
   - Click "Stop Recording"

5. **Check Validation Results**
   - Look at the test log (bottom of page) for:
     ```
     [timestamp] Initializing recording with custom WAV encoder...
     [timestamp] WAV24Encoder created: 48000Hz, 1 channels, 24-bit
     [timestamp] Recording started with custom encoder: Character Recordings
     ...
     [timestamp] WAV blob created: audio/wav, size: X.XX MB
     [timestamp] Total samples captured: XXXXXX
     [timestamp] Analyzing recorded PCM WAV...
     [timestamp] üîç WAV Header Analysis:
     [timestamp]    - Audio Format: PCM ‚Üê SHOULD SAY "PCM"
     [timestamp]    - Sample Rate (actual): 48000Hz ‚Üê SHOULD BE 48000
     [timestamp]    - Channels (actual): 1 ‚Üê SHOULD BE 1
     [timestamp]    - Bit Depth (actual): 24-bit ‚Üê SHOULD BE 24-bit
     ```

6. **Check Validation Cards**
   - Format: ‚úì Uncompressed PCM
   - Sample Rate: ‚úì 48.0 kHz
   - Bit Depth: ‚úì 24-bit
   - Channels: ‚úì Mono
   - Duration: ‚úì 5+s

7. **Download and Play**
   - Click "üì• Download Recording"
   - Play the file in any audio player
   - Should sound clear with your voice

### Full Validation (15 minutes)

Repeat the quick test for each browser:

#### Chrome
```
Testing URL: http://localhost:3000/poc/recording-test/
Expected: ‚úÖ Full support, 24-bit WAV output
```

#### Firefox
```
Testing URL: http://localhost:3000/poc/recording-test/
Expected: ‚úÖ Full support, 24-bit WAV output
```

#### Safari
```
Testing URL: http://localhost:3000/poc/recording-test/
Expected: ‚úÖ Full support, 24-bit WAV output
Microphone access: Must grant permission when browser asks
```

### Advanced Validation with `ffprobe` (optional)

After downloading a recording file, verify it's truly 24-bit:

```bash
# Install ffmpeg if you don't have it
brew install ffmpeg  # macOS
# or: apt-get install ffmpeg  # Linux
# or: choco install ffmpeg  # Windows

# Verify the WAV file properties
ffprobe recording-*.wav

# Should output something like:
# Stream #0:0: Audio: pcm_s24le (0x3420), 48000 Hz, mono, s24, 3456 kb/s
#             ‚Üë
#             THIS CONFIRMS: 24-bit PCM, 48kHz, Mono
```

## üìä What Should You See

### Success Indicators ‚úÖ

1. **No JavaScript Errors**
   - Open browser console (F12 or Cmd+Option+I)
   - Should see NO red error messages

2. **Test Log Shows Encoder Creation**
   ```
   [timestamp] Initializing recording with custom WAV encoder...
   [timestamp] WAV24Encoder created: 48000Hz, 1 channels, 24-bit
   ```

3. **WAV Header Analysis Shows**
   ```
   Audio Format: PCM ‚Üê CRITICAL: Must say "PCM", not "Compressed"
   Sample Rate (actual): 48000Hz ‚Üê CRITICAL: Must match preset
   Channels (actual): 1 ‚Üê CRITICAL: Must match preset
   Bit Depth (actual): 24-bit ‚Üê CRITICAL: Must be 24-bit
   ```

4. **All Validation Cards Show Green Checkmarks**
   ```
   Format: ‚úì Uncompressed PCM
   Sample Rate: ‚úì 48.0 kHz
   Bit Depth: ‚úì 24-bit ‚Üê THIS IS THE BIG ONE
   Channels: ‚úì Mono
   Duration: ‚úì 5+s
   ```

5. **Downloaded File Plays**
   - Audio quality is clear and clean
   - No distortion or artifacts

### Potential Issues & Troubleshooting

#### Issue 1: "Microphone permission denied"
**Solution**:
- Refresh the page
- Click "Allow" when browser asks for microphone access
- Try again

#### Issue 2: Test log shows "16-bit" instead of "24-bit"
**Solution**: This would indicate a bug in the encoder
- Check browser console for errors (F12)
- Clear browser cache and refresh
- Try a different browser
- Report details if this happens

#### Issue 3: "AudioContext not supported"
**Solution**:
- Try a different/newer browser
- Safari requires macOS 14.1+
- Chrome/Firefox should work on any recent version

#### Issue 4: Recording never finishes
**Solution**:
- Check browser console for errors
- Refresh the page
- Make sure you're using localhost:3000 (not live server)

#### Issue 5: Downloaded file won't play
**Solution**:
- Try a different media player (VLC, Audacity, etc.)
- Check if file is actually a WAV file:
  ```bash
  file recording-*.wav
  # Should say: "RIFF (little-endian) data, WAVE audio..."
  ```

## üéØ What We're Validating

### Critical Success Criteria

**Must Pass All:**
1. ‚úÖ Recording captures at 48kHz sample rate
2. ‚úÖ Recording captures 24-bit depth (not 16-bit)
3. ‚úÖ Recording captures 1 channel (Mono)
4. ‚úÖ Audio format is PCM (uncompressed)
5. ‚úÖ File is valid WAV format
6. ‚úÖ File is downloadable
7. ‚úÖ File plays in audio player
8. ‚úÖ Works on Chrome, Firefox, Safari

### Why This Matters

- **24-bit is critical** for some projects (voice acting, music, archival)
- **Custom encoder proves** we don't need external libraries
- **PCM guaranteed** means no browser variation
- **Phase 2 readiness** - we know this works and can use this code
