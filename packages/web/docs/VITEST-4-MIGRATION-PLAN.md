# Vitest 4 Upgrade Migration Plan

**Status:** In Progress
**Branch:** `feature/upgrade-vitest-4`
**Date:** 2025-10-23

## Overview
Upgrade Vitest from v3.2.4 to v4.0.1, including related packages and configuration updates.

## Risk Assessment Summary

### Breaking Changes Identified
1. **Configuration syntax change** (REQUIRED): `poolOptions.forks.singleFork` ‚Üí `maxWorkers: 1`
2. **V8 coverage provider overhaul**: More accurate AST-based remapping (coverage numbers will change)
3. **Mock behavior changes**: `vi.restoreAllMocks()` no longer resets automocks (low impact - we use manual mocks)

### Overall Risk Level
üü° **MODERATE** - One required breaking config change, expected coverage number changes, but codebase avoids deprecated patterns.

---

## Pre-Upgrade Preparation

### 1. Create Feature Branch ‚úÖ
```bash
git checkout -b feature/upgrade-vitest-4
```

### 2. Capture Baseline Metrics
```bash
# Run full test suite and record results
npm run test:run --workspace=@audio-analyzer/web

# Run coverage and save report
npm run test:coverage --workspace=@audio-analyzer/web

# Document:
# - Test pass/fail counts (baseline: 1225 tests passing)
# - Coverage percentages
# - Test execution time
```

---

## Configuration Updates

### 3. Update vitest.config.js
**File:** `packages/web/vitest.config.js`

**Change 1 - Pool Options (BREAKING - REQUIRED):**

**REMOVE (lines 40-44):**
```javascript
poolOptions: {
  forks: {
    singleFork: true
  }
}
```

**REPLACE WITH:**
```javascript
maxWorkers: 1
```

**Change 2 - Coverage Include Patterns (OPTIONAL - RECOMMENDED):**
```javascript
coverage: {
  provider: 'v8',
  include: ['src/**/*.{js,ts,svelte}'],  // Add explicit include patterns
  reporter: ['text', 'html', 'lcov'],
  exclude: [
    'node_modules/',
    'dist/',
    '**/*.test.js',
    '**/*.test.ts',
    '**/*.spec.js'
  ]
}
```

---

## Package Upgrades

### 4. Upgrade Vitest Packages
```bash
cd packages/web
npm install vitest@^4.0.1 @vitest/coverage-v8@^4.0.1 @vitest/ui@^4.0.1
```

**Packages to upgrade:**
- `vitest`: 3.2.4 ‚Üí 4.0.1
- `@vitest/coverage-v8`: 3.2.4 ‚Üí 4.0.1
- `@vitest/ui`: 3.2.4 ‚Üí 4.0.1

---

## Verification & Testing

### 5. Run Full Test Suite
```bash
npm test --workspace=@audio-analyzer/web
```

**Expected:**
- All 1225+ tests should pass
- Watch for any new failures or warnings
- Some Svelte 5 deprecation warnings are expected (not errors)

**Tests to watch:**
- `tests/unit/box-auth.test.js` (uses `vi.restoreAllMocks()`)
- Component tests (may benefit from v4 improvements)

### 6. Run Coverage Analysis
```bash
npm run test:coverage --workspace=@audio-analyzer/web
```

**Expected:**
- Coverage numbers WILL differ from v3 (AST-based remapping is more accurate)
- Reports should generate correctly
- Compare with baseline captured in step 2

### 7. Run TypeScript Checks
```bash
npm run typecheck --workspace=@audio-analyzer/web
```

**Expected:**
- No new type errors

### 8. Spot-Check Critical Tests
Manually review behavior of:
- `tests/unit/box-auth.test.js` (uses `vi.restoreAllMocks()`)
- Mock-heavy tests for any behavioral changes
- Component tests (potentially improved in v4)

---

## Documentation & Commit

### 9. Document Coverage Changes
- Note any significant coverage percentage differences in commit message
- If coverage drops significantly, investigate before committing

### 10. Commit Changes
```bash
git add packages/web/package.json packages/web/vitest.config.js package-lock.json
git commit -m "chore: upgrade Vitest from v3.2.4 to v4.0.1

- vitest: 3.2.4 ‚Üí 4.0.1
- @vitest/coverage-v8: 3.2.4 ‚Üí 4.0.1
- @vitest/ui: 3.2.4 ‚Üí 4.0.1

Configuration updates:
- Replace poolOptions.forks.singleFork with maxWorkers: 1 (breaking change)
- Add coverage.include patterns for better control

All [X] tests passing ‚úì
TypeScript type checking passed ‚úì
Coverage: [document changes if significant]

V4 uses AST-based coverage remapping (more accurate than v3).
Minor coverage percentage differences expected.

## Deployment & Integration

### 11. Follow Standard Workflow
```bash
# Push feature branch
git push origin feature/upgrade-vitest-4

# Merge to staging
git checkout staging
git pull origin staging
git merge feature/upgrade-vitest-4
git push origin staging

# Deploy to beta
cd packages/web
npm run deploy:beta

# Test at: https://audio-analyzer.tinytech.site/beta/

# When satisfied, create PR from staging ‚Üí main
gh pr create --base main --head staging --title "Release: Vitest 4 upgrade"
```

---

## Rollback Plan

If critical issues arise:

```bash
# Revert commit
git revert HEAD

# Or reset to previous commit
git reset --hard <previous-commit-hash>

# Reinstall v3 packages
npm install vitest@^3.2.4 @vitest/coverage-v8@^3.2.4 @vitest/ui@^3.2.4 --workspace=@audio-analyzer/web

# Restore original vitest.config.js
git checkout HEAD~1 -- packages/web/vitest.config.js
```

---

## Expected Outcomes

‚úÖ All tests continue to pass (1225+)
‚úÖ Coverage reports show more accurate numbers
‚úÖ Configuration compatible with Vitest 4
‚ö†Ô∏è Coverage percentages may differ (expected, more accurate)
üéØ Potential improvement: Component tests may work better in CI

---

## Risk Mitigation

- ‚úÖ All changes tested locally before merge
- ‚úÖ Beta deployment for integration testing
- ‚úÖ Full test suite validation at each step
- ‚úÖ Clear rollback path if needed
- ‚úÖ Migration plan documented for reference
