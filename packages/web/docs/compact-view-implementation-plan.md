# Compact View Mode Implementation - Completed ✅

## Overview
Implemented a toggleable "compact" view mode across ResultsTable.svelte for both Experimental and Standard analysis modes. Compact view shows only:
- Filename
- Status badge
- Failure/warning reasons (when status is not "pass")

**Status**: Completed and deployed to beta

## Implementation Summary

### 1. View Mode State ✅
- Added `viewMode` state: `'full' | 'compact'` (default: 'full')
- Stored preference in localStorage for persistence across sessions
- Implemented `toggleViewMode()` function with localStorage saving

### 2. Toggle Button ✅
- Location: Top of results table (both Experimental and Standard modes)
- Icon: ⊞ for compact, ☰ for full
- Tooltip: "Toggle compact view (shows only filename, status, and issues)"
- Hidden automatically in Filename-Only mode (already condensed)

### 3. Helper Function: `getFailureReasons()` ✅
Extracts all failures/warnings from a result, returning human-readable reasons:

**Base validation** (always applicable):
- File type, sample rate, bit depth, channels, duration, filename issues
- Specific format: "Channels: 2 (expected 1)", "Sample Rate: 44100 Hz (expected 48000)"

**Experimental metrics** (when experimentalMode = true):
- Normalization: "0.5 dB over target"
- Clipping: "0.15%"
- Noise Floor: "-50 dB"
- Reverb: "Poor (0.9s)"
- Silence: "1:30" (formatted time)
- Mic Bleed: "Detected" or "Detected (mic + headphone)"
- Speech Overlap: "15.2%"
- Stereo Type: "Mono (expected Conversational Stereo)"

### 4. Compact View Rendering ✅
When `viewMode === 'compact'`, renders simplified table with 3 columns:
```
┌─────────────────────┬──────────┬───────────────────────────┐
│ Filename            │ Status   │ Issues                    │
├─────────────────────┼──────────┼───────────────────────────┤
│ audio1.wav          │ ✓ Pass   │                           │
│ audio2.wav          │ ⚠ Warn   │ • Clipping: 0.15%        │
│                     │          │ • Reverb: Poor (0.9s)    │
│ audio3.wav          │ ✗ Fail   │ • Channels: 2 (expected 1)│
│                     │          │ • Sample Rate: 44100 Hz  │
└─────────────────────┴──────────┴───────────────────────────┘
```

### 5. Styling ✅
- Maintains existing color coding (pass/warning/fail rows)
- Issues column: Bullet list, smaller font, color-coded by severity (red errors, orange warnings)
- Responsive: Stack issues vertically on mobile
- Consistent styling across both Experimental and Standard modes

### 6. Availability ✅
**Experimental Mode**: Toggle between full metrics table and compact view
**Standard Mode**: Toggle between full analysis table and compact view
**Filename-Only Mode**: No toggle (view is already compact)

All available across all tabs (Local File, Google Drive, Box)

## Files Modified
1. **packages/web/src/components/ResultsTable.svelte**
   - Added viewMode state and localStorage persistence
   - Added toggleViewMode() function
   - Added getFailureReasons() helper function
   - Added compact view rendering for both Experimental and Standard modes
   - Added conditional logic to hide toggle in Filename-Only mode
   - Added CSS styles for compact view

## Testing Completed ✅
- ✅ Compact view works in both Experimental and Standard modes
- ✅ Tested with files that have:
  - No issues (shows empty Issues column)
  - Only validation failures (shows specific error messages)
  - Only experimental warnings (shows metrics as issues)
  - Mixed validation + experimental issues
- ✅ localStorage persistence works across sessions
- ✅ Toggle hidden in Filename-Only mode
- ✅ All 1242 tests passing
- ✅ Build successful
- ✅ Deployed to beta for user testing

1. 894746b - Initial feature (experimental mode)
2. 324430b - Fixed localStorage initialization
3. 28338a8 - Improved metric messages
4. bcc0bf4 - Fixed stereo type display
5. dfa60ff - Fixed stereo type array handling
6. 58872d0 - Fixed validation issues without detailed messages
7. 5948c7c - Made validation messages specific with actual/expected values
8. 3a74121 - Extended to standard analysis mode
9. fbc7f23 - Hidden from filename-only mode

## Next Phase: Planned Refactoring
Create `feature/unified-validation-formatting` to extract validation message formatting into a reusable utility for consistent formatting across all views (48.0 kHz, Mono/Stereo, 24-bit, etc.)
