## Executive Summary

This report documents the technical validation of the audio recording approach for the Auditions Recorder application. The POC tests critical assumptions about WAV recording, real-time analysis, browser compatibility, and performance constraints.

**Key Objective**: Validate that we can reliably record WAV audio with preset-based constraints and analyze quality in real-time.

## Implementation Notes

### Architecture Decision: MediaRecorder vs RecordRTC

**We're using MediaRecorder** (native browser API):

**Pros**:
- ✅ Built-in to all modern browsers
- ✅ Direct WAV output support
- ✅ No external library required
- ✅ Better performance (optimized by browser vendor)
- ✅ More maintainable (fewer dependencies)

**Cons**:
- Browser variations in WAV output
- May need format fallback for some browsers
- Less control over encoding parameters

**RecordRTC fallback**:
If MediaRecorder WAV output proves unreliable:
- Can integrate RecordRTC as backup
- Use for browsers that don't support WAV directly
- Installed: `npm install recordrtc`

### Real-time Analysis Strategy

**Using Web Audio API AnalyserNode**:
- Frequency bin count: 2048 (2K FFT)
- Update frequency: RequestAnimationFrame (~16ms @ 60fps)
- Data format: Float32 time-domain

**Analysis Methods**:
1. **Peak detection**: Max of absolute values in buffer
2. **Average level**: RMS (root mean square) calculation
3. **Clipping**: Count samples > 0.99 amplitude
4. **Noise floor**: Lowest 10th percentile of non-silent samples

---

## Validation Criteria

### Phase 1.5 Success Criteria

✅ **Must Have**:
- [ ] Recording captures at correct sample rate/channels
- [ ] Real-time metrics display without lag
- [ ] Browser compatibility check works
- [ ] WAV files are valid and playable
- [ ] No crashes or major errors

⚠️ **Should Have**:
- [ ] Works on Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- [ ] Performance within targets
- [ ] Mobile browser support
- [ ] Noise floor detection accurate
- [ ] Clipping detection responsive

💡 **Nice to Have**:
- [ ] Works on older browsers with fallbacks
- [ ] Advanced audio analysis features
- [ ] Custom audio constraints per device

---

## Known Limitations

### Browser-Level Constraints
- **iOS Safari**: Audio context startup requires user interaction
- **Android devices**: Some force echo cancellation despite settings
- **Firefox**: WAV output may require transcoding on some versions
- **Bluetooth headsets**: May not support all sample rates

### Implementation Constraints
- Real-time analysis runs at frame rate (capped at display refresh rate)
- Noise floor detection requires silent buffer at start
- Clipping detection is frame-based (not sample-accurate)
- Sample rate requests are "best effort" (not always honored)

### Measurement Limitations
- Peak levels show instantaneous peak (may vary with FFT size)
- Average levels are FFT-block averages (not true RMS)
- Noise floor estimated from percentile (not actual floor)
- CPU usage estimation is relative (no absolute measurement)
